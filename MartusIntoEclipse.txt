HOWTO Import Martus Client Source Code into Eclipse
2006-08-23
In the document to follow MartusClient-X.X with:
MartusClient-3.0

NOTE: This document is outdated, and needs to be updated to describe 
how to download the Martus source code from the Mercurial source code 
repository (currently on Google Code), into eclipse.


 
It is written from a GNU/Linux perspective, so if you are using MS Windows or 
Mac OS X you will have to adjust accordingly. The basic process is the same on 
all platforms.

Please submit suggestions and changes to help@martus.org


PREREQUISITES:
- Java JDK 1.5+
- Eclipse 3.1 
- MartusClient.zip (from a Martus CD or from martus.org)


Lines preceded with a '$' denote commands that should be run from a terminal.

Unzip the MartusClient zip archive:
  $ unzip MartusClient-X.X.zip
This file (MartusClient-X.X.zip) can be found on the Martus main download website www.martus.org

This will create a new dir called MartusClient-X.X in the current dir. 
From now on, we will refer to this directory as as $MARTUSCLIENT.
Create an eclipse directory:

  $ cd MartusClient-X.X/Sources
  $ mkdir eclipse
  $ cd eclipse

Unzip MartusClient-X.X-src.zip into this dir:


  $ unzip ../MartusClient-X.X-src.zip
This file (MartusClient-X.X-src.zip) is also found on SourceForge (www.SourceForge.net)

The Velocity third-party library needs to be unpacked manually:

  $ cd martus-thirdparty/common/Velocity/source
  $ unzip velocity-1.4-rc1.zip
  $ cd velocity-1.4-rc1/

Then the jar needs to be copied to the $MARTUSCLIENT/LibExt/ folder so 
eclipse can see it:

  $ cp velocity-1.4-rc1.jar $MARTUSCLIENT/LibExt/

After the jar has been copied, remove the velocity-1.4-rc1 dir.

  $ cd ../
  $ rm -r velocity-1.4-rc1

Start Eclipse
Choose or create an empty workspace
Create a new Java Project:
  File -> New -> Project -> Java Project, then Next
  Give the project a name (MartusClient-X.X might be a good choice)
  Now choose the Create project from existing source radio button
  Browse to the $MARTUSCLIENT/Sources/eclipse folder created earlier
  Click Next, and you should see all of the Martus Source listed
  Click OK


Now that the source is available to be worked on, there are a some things
that need to be modified. Martus uses a few third party libraries, and
these must be made available to Eclipse.

Within Eclipse, choose Window -> Preferences, expand Java, and click 
Installed JREs
Click 1.4.2 and then Edit
Uncheck Use default system libraries
Click Add External JARs. Browse to where the MartusClient-X.X.zip was 
extracted, and then LibExt
Highlight the following jars:
  bc-jce.jar
  bcprov-jdk14-128.jar
  icu4j_3_2_calendar.jar
  js.jar
  junit.jar
  InfiniteMonkey.jar
  persiancalendar.jar
  velocity-1.4-rc1.jar
  xmlrpc-1.2-b1.jar
Click OK
Those libraries will now show up in the window
Select bc-jce.jar, and click the Up button so that it comes _before_ Java's 
own jce.jar
Click OK

Let Eclipse rebuild your workspace. 

You should now only have warnings left stating that serializable class'
do not declare a serialVersionUID. You can safely turn off this warning:

  Select Project -> Properties
  Expand Java Compilier, choos Errors/Warnings
  Check Enable project specific settings
  Scroll to Potential programming problems, and change 
    Serializable class without serialVersionUID to Ignore, and then OK
  Eclipse will inform you that the workspace needs to be rebuilt, click Yes

You should now have the MartusClient code base cleanly imported into Eclipse
with no errors and warnings.

Next, create an eclipse Run entry that will allow you to launch Martus:
  Click the run button, and choose Java Application
  Click New
  Give this configuration a name, such as Martus
  For Main class, click Search
  Double click Martus, hit apply, and then Run
  Martus should now start

From now on, you can choose that entry from the run drop down.
