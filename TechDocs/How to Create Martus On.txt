How to Create Martus On-Line Help

Start with the Word doc of the “Martus User Guide.doc” for the language you want to create the online help for.
Save the file as a UTF8 Text file.
Close MS Word.
Open MS Word and load the UTF8 document.
Copy the Martus Version # info to the clipboard (Martus™ Software User Guide Version 3.0)
Paste this text after the Table of contents right after (1. Introduction to the Martus™ Software)
Delete from the top of the document to the first line of the Table of Contents (delete up to and including “TABLE OF CONTENTS”)
Next, go to the end of the document and remove the trailing footer left behind.
Now save the document, making sure it is still in UTF8.
Save this document as (.\martus-client\help-xx.txt) (where xx is the language code of the help file)

Now exit MS Word, bring up Eclipse and bring up “org.martus.client.tools.BuildHelp”
In the command line arguments pass in the two character language code for the help file you wish to create.

Run this program as a Java application with the command line argument provided.  This will look for the help-xx.txt file (where xx is the language code) in “.\martus-client\help-xx.txt”
Then the program will create MartusHelp-xx.txt and MartusHelpToc-xx.txt” in this same directory.

Put these new files either in the Martus Language Pack mlpFiles directory (e.g. .\binary-martus\Releases\ClientMLPs\fr\mlpFiles) or in (.\martus-client\source\org\martus\client\swingui) if you want these included in the next build.

Delete all these files from “.\martus-client” once you are done.

Remember you need to Refresh you workspace for eclipse to recognize that you updated files within this project.
