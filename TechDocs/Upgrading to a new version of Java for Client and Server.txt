Instructions for bundling Martus with Java.
Updated March 11, 2015

1.	Download and Install the Windows/Mac SDK version
    and make sure Eclipse will point to and use in order to build Martus.  
    We download the SDK for Mac so we can develop with it.
    We download the SDK for Windows so we can use the JRE sub directory 
    in the SDK for actual deployment on windows Machines.  
    During install of the SDK I usually don't install the separate JRE in the 
    ProgramFiles\Java directory, since we use the jre located in the SDK directory

2.	Copy the text files from 
	j2sdk1.8.x_XX\jre\ to .\martus-thirdparty\client\Sun\license\
	Be sure to include the license*.*, Readme.*, COPYRIGHT, and THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt

3.	Do the same for .\martus-thirdparty\server\Sun\license\ (If updating server at the same time)

4.	Edit the Readme files in 
	.\martus-thirdparty\client\Sun\Source and 
	.\martus-thirdparty\server\Sun\Source 
	adjust the version of Java we are using and update the 
	URLs to the Sun download site.

5. 	zip the JRE Folder under the Java SDKs .\binary-martus\Installer\BuildFiles\Java redist\Win32\, 
	We currently name the zip file jre8uxx.zip where xx is the specific build.
	You must also update the buildfiles/buildfile-martus-client-nsis-zip.rb
	  	    jre_zip = _('martus-build', 'BuildFiles', 'JavaRedistributables', 'Win32', 'jre8uxx.zip')
	  
6.  Do a build on the Build machine and make sure the new Java gets put onto the install CD,
	you may have to increase the size of disk space on the build machine if Java increased significantly in size.

7.  Tell Scott to update the Java on the Martus Servers. (If updating the server's Java)
