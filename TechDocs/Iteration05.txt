Project:	MartusClient
Iteration:	5
Begin:		July 9
End:		July 20
Developers:	Kevin

Expectations:
-------
Workdays: 4
Velocity: 3

Committed Stories:

1. Create/Rename/Delete Folders [2]
Cannot rename or delete any of the initial system folders. 
Initial pass will have some simple UI; a later story will be 
needed to make the interface better.

2. Save and load bulletins on disk [1]

Stories that might be started:

3. Drag bulletins between folders [2]

Results:
------
Workdays: 3
Velocity: 3

Did not pair.

Story 1 only took one day during this iteration, thanks to the work last iteration.
This is heavy UI code, so it lacks tests, and it also probably needs refactoring.

Story 2 had to be split and re-estimated:

2a. Save bulletins and folders to disk [1]
This took one full day, to create a valid, reasonable, unicode xml file. Quite a 
bit of refactoring was required.

2b. Read folders and bulletins from disk [1]
Not finished. Half day of spike on XML parsing. Ran into strange behavior 
during integration of working load functions into the app itself. Probably 
less than 1/2 day from completion. With hindsight, using SAX might not have 
been the best (simplest) option.
