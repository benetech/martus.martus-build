Project:	MartusClient
Iteration:	3
Begin:		June 11
End:		June 22
Developers:	Kevin

Expectations:
-------
Workdays: 3
Velocity: 2

Committed Stories:

1. Skeleton UI Controls[1]
To make a good demo, include non-functional Folder list, 
language dropdown, attachments, hide all check box, signin dialog.

2. Bulletin Preview [1]
Display the entire bulletin contents in a preview pane,
for whichever bulletin is selected in the list 

Future Stories that may be started:

3. Allow Fields of Different Lengths and Multiline fields [1]
Each field should specify the desired size of its input field.

4. Cool Date input [1]
Three drop down boxes for each date field. (Month, Day, Year)

5. Highlight Private Field(s) [1]
Shows a visual distinction for private fields, whether by 
highlighted background, border or text.


Results:
------
Workdays: 4
Velocity: 5

Story 1 (Skeleton) only took a couple hours, because it was 
just tossing up some Swing components.

Story 2 (Preview) only took a couple hours initially, partly 
because it had been started in the previous iteration. Later, 
it needed about 1/2 day of refactoring.

Story 3 (Multiline) only took a couple hours. There are only 
two field lengths right now: NORMAL and MULTILINE.

Story 4 (Cool dates) took almost one day.

We lost about 1/2 day to a weird problem where bulletins were 
jumping around on the screen. It was a Swing oddity that we 
worked around by putting scrollbars on the multiline text 
fields, and not allowing them to visually grow. 

Story 5 (Highlight Private Fields) took a full day. It turned 
out to be quite complex, involving nesting "Listeners" three 
levels deep. Quite a bit of refactoring of the existing code 
was also required to make the feature easier to add.
