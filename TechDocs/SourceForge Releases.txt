NOTE: You can NOT delete a release once you create it, you can only hide it which I found out.

Step 2:   Add Files To This Release

Upload to the FTP server the files
Use an FTP client upload.sourceforge.net
go to the "incoming" directory
upload the file.
Add both the zip file and the sha1 value.
Eg. martus-client-3.1-src.zip and martus-client-3.1-src.zip.sh1
The source zip file is located on the build machine, but if you don't have access to that machine, you can always download it since it is contained in the ISO image.
 
Look for and check the file you uploaded to the ftp website. Make sure your FTP has finished uploading before adding the file. click on "Add Files and/or Refresh View"
 
Step 3:   Edit Files In This Release

File Type "Source Zip" for the zip file and "Text" for the sha1 file
Release Version "Shouldn't need to adjust this"
Release Date "Shouldn't need to adjust this"
click on "Update/Refresh"
