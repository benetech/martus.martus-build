Go to 
http://sourceforge.net/account/login.php?return_to=%2Fmy%2Fmyprojects.php

File Release System
scroll down to the section "File Release Packages"
click on "Add Release" or "Edit Release" (to update something) 
beside either the "Developer Docs", "martus" (Client) or "Martus Server".
 
Create a File Release
New release name: (type in version # eg. "3.3")
click on "Create This Release"
 
NOTE: You can NOT delete a release once you create it, 
you can only hide it which I found out.  
So now there are bogus Martus Server 2.6.0.0, and 2.6.0.0.0 and Developer docs 1.01 releases 
which will show up in the Admin section.  
These unused releases can be renamed in the future and used. 
Once you Create a File Release it will take you to 
 
Step 1:   Edit Existing Release

Release Notes and the Change Log check the box "Preserve my pre-formatted text."

i.e.

A. Changes from version 3.0 to version 3.1

Step 2:   Add Files To This Release

Upload to the SFTP server the files.
Use an SFTP client (FTP no longer is accepted) 
A good SFTP client is WinSCP found at http://winscp.net/eng/index.php

host: frs.sourceforge.net 
go to the "uploads" directory
upload the files.
Add both the zip file and the sha1 value.
Eg. martus-client-3.3-src.zip and martus-client-3.3-src.zip.sh1
The source zip file is located on the build machine, but if you 
don't have access to that machine, you can always download it 
since it is contained in the ISO image.
 
Look for and check the file you uploaded to the ftp website. 
Make sure your FTP has finished uploading before adding the file. 
click on "Add Files and/or Refresh View"
 
Step 3:   Edit Files In This Release
 
Processor "Platform Independent"
File Type "Source Zip" for the zip file and "Text" for the sha1 file
Release Version "Shouldn't need to adjust this"
Release Date "Shouldn't need to adjust this"
click on "Update/Refresh"
 
Step 4:   Email Release Notice
 
Send Notice to users monitoring the package if any.
