If that link doesn't work use http://sourceforge.net/ 
Log in using "benetech" and the password given.  


Occasionally when you log in it will ask you to change the password.  
Change this to some temp password then you can go in to Account/Account Options and 
scroll down to change password to reset it back to the Benetech password which 
Scott has saved in the safe at Benetech.
If you have to request a password change the password will go to sourcebenetech@benetech.org

Create a File Release
Right click on "Martus" folder and select 'New Folder': (type in version # eg. "3.3.2")
 
You can now easily delete folders by right clicking on them and selecting 'delete'

Step 1:   Obtain the source file(s) to be uploaded

The source zip file and its corresponding SHA1 (.sh1) file is 
contained in the ISO image as part of the Martus release, 
so you can download the ISO file and retrieve it from there.

DO NOT just use the files from the build machine, 
as another build may have been performed after the release build, 
so the source code may have changed.

Better way is to download the ISO's directly from the HRDag Network
https://hrdag.benetech.org/martus-client/Releases/Build/1977/ is 3.6.1
You will need a user name / password to connect to this Network.
Then burn the ISO to a CD rom then go and get the src zip file from the Source's directory on the CD rom.
Or get the souces and sha1 directly from the HRDAG build directory and upload these.

Step 2:   Add Files To This Release

Right click on the folder you just created and select 'Upload Here'
You will get confirmation that the new files uploaded will go into the correct release folder.
Now scroll back up to the top of the page and click on 'Upload File' right under the 
File Manager Header. 

martus-client-3.3.2-src.zip
martus-client-3.3.2-src.zip.sh1 (may need to creat this using LLMD5Sum program (remember to switch to SHA1)
Instructions_Converting_CSV_to_Martus_Bulletin-v332.zip (I usuaully download the previous version then change the version # in the zip file name)

Step 3: Selecting this zip to be the default download

After you create the directory for the version #
Eg. 3.6.1
Then click on that directory then click on the button to "Add Files"
Select the zip and the zip.sh1 files and upload both.
Then click on the zip files i (View Details) button after files have been uploaded and select All for the Default Download for Platforms
