On Mac / Linux 

Do the following once set up HG to know about Google

1. edit ~/.hgrc and add the following (with your information)

[auth]
google.prefix = https://code.google.com/p/
google.username = charlesl@benespace.org
google.password = xxxxxxx

(NOTE: to get your password you need to log into your account on Google code 
https://code.google.com/p/martus/
Profile/Settings, there will be your password at the top to push/pull from Google. 

2. In each project directory go and edit the .hg/hgrc file and add google to the Paths
eg. martus-build/.hg/hgrc

[paths]
default = ssh://mvcs/martus/martus-build
google = https://charlesl%40benespace.org@code.google.com/p/martus.martus-build

just change your name above (not default should already exist)

*IMPORTANT* Make sure you update each project and that you point google to also the correct sub-project
IE. if you are editing martus-swing/.hg/hgrc that the google also points to martus-swing

Now edit the bash script with the correct tag you wish to push.

1. edit martus-build/push-client-tag-google-script.bash
2. update tag="Client-5.0.0" to the tag you wish to push
3. run this bash script from the terminal
