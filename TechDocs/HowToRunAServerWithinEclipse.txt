First go to martus-server project
org.martus.server.main you will find MartusServer.java
Either Run/Debug this as needed.

(if not provided in the command line arguments
For Windows the default directory 
C:/MartusServer/
For all other OS's the default directory will be 
/var/MartusServer/
To set the default Server directory via the command line you will have (--data-directory=...)

All directories will be created automatically.
In the server directory there will be a deleteOnStartup directory which keypair.dat must first be copied into.
If you don't already have this file you will need to create one by

Creating Martus Server KeyPair
------------------------------
martus-server
org.martus.server.tools and run CreateKeyPair.java
The command line argument must have --keypair=xxx where xxx is the directory and file name to the keypair.dat file you wish to create
Eg. for windows --keypair=C:\MartusServer\deleteOnStartup\keypair.dat

NOTE:  For developers if you run INSECURE the MartusServer\deleteOnStartup directory won't be deleted so we can keep the keypair.dat 
file in this directory and not have to copy it over each time you run the server.

NOTE: if you use the password for your keypair.dat file as "password" then you can pass in --nopassword as a command line argument 
when running the server so it won't prompt you for the password each time.  DON'T DO THIS FOR A REAL SERVER!
When you run the CreateKeyPair it will ask for a password and takes approximately 30 seconds to create the file.  Moving mouse can help
with System's Entropy during the process but shouldn't be needed.
It will tell you your public code which is important but you don't need to copy it down since it is displayed on the console each time 
the server is ran so if needed you can grab it then.

Starting Martus Server
----------------------

In addition to keypair.dat file being needed in /deleteOnStartup directory there must also be a compliance.txt file which should just say 
"This is a development server and shouldn't be trusted"  For a real server you should obtain a sample of this file from Benetech 

Command Line Arguments
See MartusServer.java (processCommandLine()) for a complete list of command line arguments

Here are a couple of the more common arguments when setting up a server for Martus clients
--nopassword (will use "password") and not prompt you for one each time
--client-listener (will be used if you want Martus Clients to be able to connect to this server)

You will be told what is the IP address you can use to connect your Martus Client to.

You can for now ignore the following SEVERE: NOTE: getActiveRunnerCount is no longer implemented
Eventually we'll just take those out, because the new xmlrpc doesn't really let us track activerunners
and the reason we originally added that output doesn't exactly exist any more, there is a TT to fix this error.

You can also ignore the following ERROR which happens during startup.
ERROR: ::tname=Timer-3:: BackgroundTimerTick - Mirroring/Amp data pull: Timer may be wedged, last invoked Wed 12/31 16:00:00 PST
