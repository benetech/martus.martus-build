Project:	MartusClient
Iteration:	4
Begin:		June 25
End:		July 6
Developers:	Kevin

Expectations:
-------
Workdays: 3
Velocity: 3.25

Committed Stories:

1. Simulated Send-to-Server dialog with progress bar [1/2]
Rename "Save" button to "Send" and make it button-sized. 
Add a do-nothing "Save Draft" button. Always display "Sent" 
in the status column. Bring up a dialog with a timed progress 
bar that simulates transferring data to a server.

2. Center signon dialog [1/4]

3. Change date format to dd-mm-yyyy [1/4]
First switch the combos in create, then the display in preview, 
and finally the display in the list.

4. Add maximize button to create dialog [almost zero]

5. Try to solve scrolling problem that appears on Marc's system [1/4]

6. Create/Rename/Delete Folders [2]
Cannot rename or delete any of the initial system folders. 
Initial pass will have some simple UI; a later story will be 
needed to make the interface better.

Possible Stories:

7. Save and load bulletins on disk [1]



Results:
------
Workdays: 3
Velocity: 2.25

Dave paired with me on story 3. Otherwise I worked alone.

Story 1 took almost 1/2 day, due to becoming familiar with new Java components.
Story 2 took about an hour, because Java doesn't have a "Center" command.
Story 3 took Dave and I about an hour.
Story 4 took ten minutes.
Story 5 took a half hour to code a potential workaround, and then make it real.
Story 6 needed to be split:
	6a. Allow user to click on a folder and have the list display those bulletins [1]
	6b. Allow user to create/rename/delete folders [2]
Story 6a was completed, but story 6b was only half(?) finished within this iteration.
