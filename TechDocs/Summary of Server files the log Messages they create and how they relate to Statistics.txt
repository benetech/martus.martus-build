Summary of Server files the log Messages they create, and how they relate to Statistics
Version 1.1

Notes
    All directories are relative to the MartusServer directory.
    SE (Search Engine) is the new name for the Martus Amplifier
 
 
Backup Server Talking to an Amplifier  (AKA: ServerForAmpliers)
    Must have the following command line arguments to run 
    (--listeners-ip=x.x.x.x --amplifier-listener)
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\ampsWhoCallUs\
        Inside this directory contains all keys of which amps are authorized to call us.
        Log Message generated "ServerForAmp Notice: Authorized X amplifiers to call us"
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\clientsNotToAmplify.txt
        This lists all client accounts which will never be sent to any amplifier 
        (all bulletins from these accounts wont be sent to an amplifier)
        Log Message generated "ServerForAmp Notice: Not authorized to amplify X clients."
        CreateStatistics accounts.cvs "can amplify" is set from this file as well.
		The intention of this is (was) solely to avoid test accounts from being amplified. 
		It was not intended to censor data, nor to hide all bulletins belonging to a 
		legitimate account.
		By controlling it at the backup server level, rather than at the SE level, 
		we can prevent our test bulletins from being pulled by a third-party SE 
		(if such a thing existed and were authorized to pull from us). Now that we support 
		this at the SE level, I would vote to remove this feature.


 
    \DeleteOnStartup\amplify_mirrored_bulletins_for_testing.txt
        If this exists we will amplify mirrored bulletins as well as bulletins originally 
        uploaded to this server.
        Log Message generated "ServerForAmp Warning: AMPLIFYING MIRRORED BULLETINS FOR TEST."
        Just added for testing only.
		Kevin: Last I heard, we believe this behavior will eventually be the default--
			that all backup servers will offer mirrored public bulletins to their SE's. 
			However, the FINAL decision has not yet been made.
 
Amplifier Server (AKA Martus Search Engine - MartusAmplifier)
    Must have the following command line arguments to run 
    (--amplifier --amplifier-ip=x.x.x.x --amplifier-indexing-minutes=xx)
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\webauthorized.txt
        If this file does not exist the Search Engine's Webpage is NOT password protected 
        and will generate the following log
            Log Message generated "Amp Notice: 
            	** No password Required for Martus Web Search Engine **"
        If the file exists, the first line of the file is the user name, the second line 
        is the password
            Log Message generated "Amp Notice: password Required Martus Web Search Engine"
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\serversWhoWeCall\
        Inside this directory contains all keys of which backup servers we will call.  
        (Note: the backup Server we are calling must authorize us to call and have our 
        public key in their "ampsWhoCallUs" directory)
            Log Message generated for each server we can call "Amp Notice: will call: 
            <File name of server's key>"
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\accountsNotAmplified.txt
        All accounts which may or may not have been amplified to us, but we will NOT display 
        on the search engine.
        Log Message generated "Amp Notice: X account(s) will not get amplified"
        CreateStatistics DOES NOT look at this file currently, maybe it should.
		Scott:  CreateStatistics should look at this file.  This is why the "can amplify" 
		fields are invalid (stuck at 1).
		Charles: New TestTrack to fix this by adding in two new columns for AmpCanAmplify
		and ServerCanAmplify, and have "can amplfiy" be the combination of both.  This
		has not yet been implemented.

 
Mirroring (AKA ServerForMirroring)
    
    Must have the following command line arguments to run 
    (--listeners-ip=x.x.x.x --mirror-listener)
    
    \DeleteOnStartup\mirrorConfig.txt
        If this file exists the mirroring Interval will be every second, and the inactive 
        Sleep is 1 minute.
        If this file doesn't exist the mirroring Interval will be every 10 seconds, 
        and the inactive Sleep is 15 minutes.
        Log Message generated "ServerForMirror Notice: MirroringInterval (seconds): X" 
        Log Message generated "ServerForMirror Notice: InactiveSleep (minutes): X"
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\mirrorsWhoCallUs\
        Inside this directory contains all keys of which mirrors who we authorized to call us.
        Log Message generated "ServerForMirror Notice: Authorized X Mirrors to call us");
        Servers who call us are those that will RECEIVE our bulletins.

    \DeleteOnStartup\mirrorsWhoWeCall\
        Inside this directory contains all keys of which mirrors who we will call.  
        (Note: the Mirror we are calling must authorize us to call and have our public 
         key in their "mirrorsWhoCallUs" directory)
       Log Message generated for each configured mirror we call "Notice: We will call: 
       <Mirror's File name>"
       Log Message generated "ServerForMirror Notice: Configured to call X Mirrors"
	   Servers who we call are those whose bulletins we will RECEIVE.
 
Backup Server (AKA Martus Server For Clients)
    Must have the following command line arguments to run 
    (--listeners-ip=x.x.x.x --client-listener)
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\banned.txt
        All clients which currently can not upload bulletins to this server.  
        They receive a News message telling them they are banned.
        Message generated "X  client(s) are currently banned"
        CreateStatistics accounts.cvs field "banned" reflects this information.
        Banned clients cannot perform any server tasks. 
        They cannot retrieve their bulletins or view their field office bulletins.
    
    \uploadsok.txt
        All clients which have been authorized to upload bulletins to this server by 
        providing a valid magic word are in this file.
        Message generated "X client(s) currently allowed to upload"
       CreateStatistics accounts.cvs "can amplify" is set from this file as well. 
       CreateStatistics accounts.cvs "date authorized" is set from this file as well.
       CreateStatistics accounts.cvs "group" is set from this file as well.
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\magicwords.txt
        All active/inactive magic words are contained within this file, which the martus 
        clients use to be authorized in "uploadsok.txt"
        Message generated "X active magic word(s)"
        Message generated "X inactive magic word(s)"
		Inactive magic words are flagged with a leading #. 
		Blank lines will generate log warnings. 
		An empty magicwords.txt file will generate a log warning.
		Each magic word in this file is also annotated with the group it was associated with.

    \DeleteOnStartup\isTester.txt
        Currently only used for Creating Statistics.  We may also not amplify these tester 
        accounts but we have yet to implement this.
        Message generated "X client(s) are known test accounts"
        CreateStatistics accounts.cvs field "tester" reflects this information 
        CreateStatistics bulletins.cvs field "test bulletin" for each bulletin created by 
        this account reflects this information
		Kevin: 
			It is not clear to me why we have this in addition to the other two mechanisms 
			that are solely designed to omit test account bulletins from the SE. 
			I think we were worried about having some accounts marked "do not amplify" that 
			were not actually test accounts. I don't think we should, and if we don't, 
			these features should be merged...and again I would vote to eliminate them 
			in favor of the SE-level "do not amplify" feature, which we could rename to 
			make it clear it is only intended to hide test accounts.
 
    \DeleteOnStartup\isHidden.txt
        Contains a list of hidden/deleted bulletin id's from the server.  These bulletin's 
        will not be listed to any client, mirror or amplifier.
        Log Message generated "Info: X bulletins hidden."
   
        CreateStatistics bulletins.cvs field "hidden on server" reflects this information
		Users cannot "re-upload" bulletins listed in isHidden.txt. Apparently this does not 
		prevent a user from uploading a newer version of the hidden bulletin.
       
   \News\
   		This directory can contain any number of "news" items or can be empty if no news
   		is available.  Any file in this directory (which must be a UTF8 text file) will get
   		sent to any Martus Client 1.5 and beyond as soon as they connect to this server.
   		The message inside the text file will be what the user sees.
   		Currently the user will see all messages each time the user connect to this server 
   		(i.e. starts Martus with this server configured and has an internet connection).
   		In future client versions we may have the client aknowledge the news item so 
   		they dont have to see it again, but currently as of 2.7 this has not been implemented.
        Message generated "X News items"
