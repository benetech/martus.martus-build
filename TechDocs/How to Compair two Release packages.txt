How to compare releases to ensure only the files you expect to change did.

1. First download the current release and the previous release from the Jenkins website
https://hrdag.benetech.org/martus-client/Releases/jenkins/
Eg:
MartusClient-Linux-5.0.1-3485-404.zip 
MartusClient-Linux-5.0.2-3486-405.zip

2. unzip both zip files into two separate folders

3. unzip the Martus.jar

4. unzip the SourceFiles/martus-sources.zip

5. use your favorite directory/file comparison utility 
   (Mac you can try the command line diff program) 
   (Linux you may try diff/meld program)
   Remember to make sure it compares recursivly 
   Ex:  diff -r MartusClient-5.0.1 MartusClient-5.0.2
   
6. At a minimum the following files should have changed.

	README.txt

	/SourceFiles/martus-sources.zip 
	/SourceFiles/martus-sources/org/martus/client/swingui/UiConstants.java
	/SourceFiles/martus-sources/org/martus/common/VersionBuildDate.java

	/martus.jar
	/martus/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
	/martus/META-INF/SSMTSJAR.RSA
	/martus/META-INF/SSMTSJAR.SF
