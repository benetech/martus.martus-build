How to add a new third-party library to Martus
2007-09-03 Kevin Smith

This is VERY VERY rough, so don't believe any of it!

First, commit the compiled .jar, the source code file (e.g. .zip) and license to the 
appropriate directory under martus-thirdparty.

In build.shared.values.xml:

1. add an entry for this new third-party jar, such as:

    <property name="martus.thirdparty.lib.jhlabs"
      value="${build.basedir}/${martus.thirdparty.module}/client/jhlabs/bin/"/>
      
2. Add a line to each build-xxx.xml in the path section, like:

	<fileset dir="${martus.thirdparty.lib.jhlabs}" includes="**/*.jar"/>

In MartusBuild.sh:
1. Add a line to inside the copyThirdPartyJarToCDBuild function, like:

	cp -v $SRC_THIRDPARTY_JARS_CLIENT_DIR/jhlabs/bin/*.jar $BUILDFILES_JARS/

2. Add two lines to the copyThirdPartySourceToCDBuild function, like:

	mkdir -p $BUILDFILES_SRC_FILES/jhlabs
	cp -v $CVS_HOME/martus-thirdparty/client/jhlabs/src/* $BUILDFILES_SRC_FILES/RhinoJavaScript/
	
3. Add two lines to the copyThirdPartyLicenseToCDBuild function, like:

	mkdir -p $BUILDFILES_LICENSES/jhlabs
	cp -v $CVS_HOME/martus-thirdparty/client/jhlabs/license/* $BUILDFILES_LICENSES/jhlabs/
