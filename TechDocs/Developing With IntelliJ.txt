Developing Martus with IntelliJ

1. When you first import the project, IntelliJ may create a library called OldJars.
Delete this library under Project Settings, Libraries.

2. In the  Project Settings, Project screen, click the Edit button next to Project SDK.
Add the following jar, ../martus-bc-jce/bc-jce.jar
Remove the system jce.jar file (should be somewhere near the top) and re-add it so its now below the bc-jce.jar file.

3. In order to run the desktop client, change the Run Configuration for the org.martus.client.swingui.Martus class.
Add the following under VM Options: -Xbootclasspath/p:/Users/roms/boss/martus-main/martus-bc-jce/bc-jce.jar
where the path is the fully qualified path to that jar in your machine .
