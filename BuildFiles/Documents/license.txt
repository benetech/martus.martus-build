The Martus(TM) Software License

Copyright 2002-2009, Beneficent Technology, Inc. ("Benetech" or " Licensor"), Palo 
Alto, California.  This software is expressly subject to the accompanying GNU GPL 
License (attached in the file GPL.TXT), and these additional terms, all of which 
constitute the full Martus license, and all of which you should read carefully.   Both the 
Martus license additions and the accompanying GPL license will apply in all situations 
where the Martus software is redistributed pursuant to the GPL license terms. Reference 
below to "the License" means both these terms and the accompanying GPL license.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  This copyrighted Martus(TM) Software (the 
"Software") is licensed and distributed free of any cost, except for reproduction and 
distribution expenses when distributed on CD.  It may only be used subject to these 
express terms of use, which modify the accompanying GPL license that governs the 
copyright license. It is distributed WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED,  including warranties of fitness of purpose or merchantability.  It is not 
intended nor available as a "Consumer Product" under the laws of any state of the U.S. or 
any other country.  The Licensee and others using the software under the auspices of the 
Licensee assume all risk of failure and errors in the Software and its functionality, 
specifically including (without limitation of any other type of malfunction or improper 
operation) errors in encryption and security functionality.  All software is inherently 
subject to errors and malfunctions when in field use, especially when the source code is 
Open Source and subject to modification by anyone using it. This software may have 
been modified by third parties, over which Licensor has no control. The Licensee and 
others using it assume the risk of lack of support and the effect of possible third party 
modifications. This License will automatically and irrevocably terminate for all purposes 
immediately, without further notice of any kind, upon any assertion of a legal claim for 
support or warranty by the Licensee, since this License would not be granted if it carried 
any such obligations. Licensor, however, welcomes reports of apparent errors from users.

EFFECT OF INVALIDITY DETERMINATION ON LICENSE.  Should any provision 
or condition of these terms or of the GPL license itself be held improper, illegal or 
unenforceable, all of the other provisions of these terms and the GPL license shall 
nonetheless remain in full force and effect, but without the improper, illegal or 
unenforceable provision; provided however that if this Disclaimer of Warranty should be 
held improper, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, then the entire GPL License 
shall terminate immediately upon any such determination by a court, arbitrator or other 
tribunal, and the Licensee shall have no further right to use, distribute, modify or possess 
the Software for any purpose whatsoever, other than for a backup copy kept for purposes 
of reading out the database of information to some other program or format reasonably 
necessary to use the data without this program. This is an essential term of these terms 
and the GPL license without which Licensor would not have granted any right to this 
software for any purpose.

CRYPTOGRAPHY.  This software package uses strong cryptography, which falls under 
certain export/import and/or use restrictions in the United States and some other parts of 
the world. 

PLEASE REMEMBER THAT EXPORT/IMPORT AND/OR USE OF STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY SOFTWARE, PROVIDING CRYPTOGRAPHY HOOKS OR 
EVEN COMMUNICATING TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY 
SOFTWARE IS ILLEGAL IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD. SO, WHEN YOU 
IMPORT THIS PACKAGE TO YOUR COUNTRY, RE-DISTRIBUTE IT FROM 
THERE OR EVEN EMAIL TECHNICAL SUGGESTIONS OR EVEN SOURCE 
PATCHES TO THE AUTHOR OR OTHER PEOPLE, YOU ARE STRONGLY 
ADVISED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ANY EXPORT/IMPORT AND/OR USE 
LAWS WHICH APPLY TO YOU. THE LICENSOR OF THE MARTUS SOFTWARE 
IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY OF YOUR VIOLATIONS OF LOCAL LAWS, SO BE 
CAREFUL, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPLY WITH SUCH LAWS.

MODIFICATION AND NOTIFICATION.  You are welcome to modify or re-use any 
portions of the Software within other unrelated applications, subject to the terms of this 
license, so long as you do NOT use the Benetech name or the Martus trademark in any 
way in conjunction with such activities.  An application is considered to be "related to 
Martus" if it uses the Martus name in a user-visible location in the Software or 
documentation, creates Martus-compatible bulletins, decrypts private Martus-compatible 
bulletin data, or supports any Martus client or server communications API call.  For 
applications related to Martus, you must comply with the following user notification 
requirements if you either modify the Software, or if you choose to operate the Software 
in a server environment that is not in accordance with the then-current Martus Server 
Operational Requirements as set forth, from time to time, by Benetech at 
www.martus.org.  The objective of this requirement is that users should always know if 
they are using a non-standard version of Martus, and be able to fully determine the non-
standard aspects of such software or server operation.  
For all modified Martus client software, you must add the following quoted notification 
language to a splash screen (or in an equivalent manner in non-GUI environments) that is 
presented to the user and is clearly visible upon program startup: 
"This software is not a standard Martus(TM) program, because it has been 
modified by someone other than Benetech, the copyright owner and original 
author of the Martus software.  For details of what has been changed, see 
[*here*]."  
For non-compliant Martus server environments (server software changes or operational 
differences from the Martus Server Operational Requirements), you must (a) send a 
notification message using the Martus communications API that exists for this purpose, 
with the following quoted notification language, and (b) cause the following quoted 
notification language to be displayed and clearly visible upon signing on to anyone who 
logs in to the server.   
"This service is not a standard Martus(TM) service, because it has been modified 
by someone other than Benetech, the copyright owner and original author of the 
Martus software, or is not being operated in accordance with Benetech's server 
recommendations.  For details of what has been changed, see [*here*]." 
 
The reference to [*here*] in such notifications should be a link to both a summary of the 
changes in layman's terms and the modified source code, if applicable, documented per 
the GPL.  If you have proposed improvements to the software you would like to submit 
to Benetech for possible inclusion in future releases, and are willing to assign the 
copyright to Benetech, send email to improvements@martus.org.  
TRADEMARK CONTROL.  Neither the names or marks Martus(TM) nor Benetech may 
be used to identify any products or services derived from this source code without the 
prior express written permission from Benetech, except when you include the notice of 
modification as set forth in the foregoing paragraph.  To apply for such permission, send 
email to permissions@martus.org describing your request and the changes and/or use 
proposed in detail.  

USAGES THAT VIOLATE THIS LICENSE.  To apply for permissions to incorporate 
some of the Software in a product or project in a manner that doesn't comply with the 
license terms hereof (such as use in a closed-source commercial product), send email to 
permissions@martus.org describing your request and the changes and/or use proposed in 
detail.  You may not use or distribute the software in a way that violates any terms of this 
license until after you have requested and received written permission from Benetech to 
do so.

Because the Software includes Sun Microsystems Java programs, we need to include 
some special license terms because of the use of this Java technology.  The Martus 
software continues to be free, but we need to tell you the details of how this works.  

Linking this software statically or dynamically with other modules constitutes a 
combined work based on the Martus software.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the 
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright owners of the Martus software give you permission 
to link our software with the Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) for Java 2 Platform Standard 
Edition (J2SE TM) v 1.4.1_01 or later from Sun Microsystems (java.sun.com), regardless of the 
license terms of this module, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined work under 
terms of your choice; provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete 
copy of the source code of that combined work (excluding the above-mentioned module).  Use of 
the source code of the combined work shall continue to be subject to the terms of the GNU 
General Public License and the terms of this license.  This permission to link does not override 
the license terms of such modules, which still apply to usage of such module.

Note that people who make modified versions of the Software are not obligated to grant 
this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so.  
The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a modified version without 
this exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version that 
carries forward this exception.
