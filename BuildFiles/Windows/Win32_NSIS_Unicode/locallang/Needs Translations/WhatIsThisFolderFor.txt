Needs Translation is just a place to group all the translations in one place that need updating.
This directory is not used by the build script and is copies of the files from the real directories.

For each language there is the "Martus" .NSH file in the root directory.
There may also be a sub-directory NSIS_Contrib with a .NSH and .NLF for those languages which currently do not have a NSIS supported language such as 
Burmese, Napali, Bengali and Khmer.

The root file Eg Burmese.nsh goes in 
\martus-build\BuildFiles\Windows\Win32_NSIS_Unicode\locallang  (Used by Build)

The 2 files in the NSIS_Contrib (if present) get put into  
\martus-build\BuildFiles\Windows\Win32_NSIS_Unicode\NSIS\Contrib (not used by build) (just 1 place for all our own NSIS files we have modified.)

These NSIS_Contrib also get put on the Build Machine in the NSIS directory
\NSIS\Contrib\Language files (Used by build)
